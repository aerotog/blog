- Clean Code - comments are bad, mmm kay?
    - But comments are sometimes necessary
    - Comment when being clever
    - Helper functions don't always make sense, code should be logically grouped
- Cargo cult programming. Don't blindly copy paste. Understand what you are doing
    - Time and a place. Tight time constraints might forego understanding. This is technicaly debt. Fight it when possible. Understand when making concessions.
