It’s hosted by Elecia and Christopher White where they discuss a wide range of software engineering topics with different guests. Usually these topics are focused more on the embedded side of things, hence the name.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, my 3D printer broken due to a shorted power connector for the heat bed. I found a solution online and ended up ordering a replacement terminal on <a href=\"https://www.digikey.com/\">Digi-Key</a>. While I was searching for the right parts, I noticed how easy it was to find things on both Digi-Key and Amazon that many years ago I would have gone to Radio Shack with a 50/50 shot of actually finding.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, I dug through my closet and found my old Arduino. Several years back, I had purchased it along with a strip of addressable LEDs for a costume project that didn’t pan out. But having recently listened to interviews with different <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture\">makers</a> from Embedded.fm, I was inspired to brush off the webs and hook it up.</p>\n<p>While admiring the brightly flashing LEDs along with how easy they were control thanks to the <a href=\"http://fastled.io/\">FastLED</a> library. I started looking online to see what was new in the world of the embedded system hobby. What I found was quite surprising, to say the least.</p>\n<p>Since I last looked at hobby embedded projects several years back, there seems to be a drastic increase in variety and availability of hardware along with a substantial drop in prices. (Thanks to the wild west of Chinese clones) On Amazon I found some WiFi enabled boards using the ESP8266 chip for less than $5 each which sounded like a steal.</p>\n<p>A few short days later, I had a web server running on a microcontroller that could control LEDs. This was a Eureka moment for me. I had given up developing on the Arduino in part because it was so difficult to control/interface with. But with WiFi and the ability of the board to act as either a web server or a web client, the possibilities have grown drastically.</p>\n<p>I spent the next several days scouring the internet for parts and ended up ordering large number of components from Amazon and AliExpress. My current plants include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WiFi enabled binary wall clock and weather indicator</li>\n<li>WiFi controlled Christmas tree lights</li>\n<li>WiFi controlled car ground effect and interior floor lighting</li>\n<li>Custom TV ambient light system using Raspberry Pi 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first three will all run off an ESP8266 chip while the last will use a Raspberry Pi 3 since I already had some of the required hardware lying around.</p>\n<p>And of course in the age of cloud computing and single page apps, this wouldn’t be complete without one: Autodesk offers a free online Arduino simulator called <a href=\"https://www.tinkercad.com/\">Tinkercad</a>. This web app lets you design and test circuits as well as Arduino code in either block or text form. I found this immensely useful for testing various code ideas since flashing the development boards takes much longer. (Which also helps prolong the microcontroller’s life since the EEPROM/flash memory writes are limited)</p>\n<p>I’ve started a <a href=\"https://github.com/aerotog/embedded\">new Github repo</a> where I’ll store my various Arduino sketches. I hope to have some if not all of these projects completed by year end. At the very least, this will be a good way to brush up on my C/C++. Depending on how they turn out, I’ll probably make a separate blog post for each project with pictures.</p>\n<p>~EOF~</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Just Embedded Things","date":"October 12, 2020","description":"Arduinos, and wires, and Pis, oh my!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/embedded-1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/rest/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A REST API by any other name"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1967767509","3000541721"]}
